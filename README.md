Major Project 2: 
NLP Application

Task Selection: Sentiment Analysis

Objective: To classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

Data Preprocessing
1.	Data Acquisition: Load the IMDB movie review dataset.
2.	Text Cleaning: Remove stop words, punctuation, and convert text to lowercase.
3.	Tokenization: Split text into individual words or tokens.
4.	Text Representation: Use TF-IDF to convert text into numerical vectors.

Model Selection
•	Random Forest Classifier: A popular ensemble learning algorithm for classification tasks.

Model Training

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score

# Load dataset (replace with your data)
X = ...  # List of movie reviews
y = ...  # Corresponding sentiment labels (0 or 1)

# Preprocessing
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_vectorized, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("F1-score:", f1)

Results Presentation
•	Discuss the model's performance based on accuracy and F1-score.
•	Analyze the model's strengths and weaknesses.
•	Explore potential improvements, such as using different models or preprocessing techniques.

Additional Considerations:
•	Deep Learning Models: For more complex tasks, consider using deep learning models like LSTM or Transformer.
•	Evaluation Metrics: Choose appropriate evaluation metrics based on your task (e.g., BLEU score for machine translation, ROUGE score for summarization).
•	Data Augmentation: If your dataset is small, consider techniques like data augmentation to increase its size.
